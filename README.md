### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Cinnamon AI as a Research Engineer, working on reducing time in machine learning production pipeline 
- 📫 You can reach me through my linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tphat/
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI competitions or research on visual-linguistic AI tasks (Image Captioning, VQA, Text-to-Image search, etc.)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wish I have telekinematic skills like Eleven in Stranger Things so I can move things around cuz I feel lazy sometimes
